## About

Bakery Link is a web application that will make ordering custom cakes and baked goods ... a piece of cake! It is a full-stack MERN application that allows customers to order custom cakes and baked goods. Bakeries can use it to manage orders and keep track of inventory in an online database.

### How It Works
* There are two ways to sign up for Bakery Link: as a customer or as a bakery.
* Customers can fill in a order form with data such as identifying information, specifications for a custom cake such as size, flavor, buttercream flavors, as well as quantities for cookies and/or cupcakes. The mapquest feature of the order form will take into account which bakery they are closest to.
* Bakery staff can fill in an order form with the same data, or update existing forms with price and order status.
* Bakery staff can also view available inventory which will be displayed as a chart. 
* Bakery staff can also view orders that have been made.  

### Motivation

To make cake and baked goods orders easily customizable, and to make managing orders easier for bakeries.
